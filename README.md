# ChestDrop
Spawns a chest in random coordinates within 1000 blocks 
The chest contains some enderpearls, gold, food and blaze rods.
Commands:
  -"chestdrop"

I made this plugin for SpeedRunner vs Hunter, as me and my friends where playing we noticed that we needed a little help getting the enderpearls, and this did the trick.
